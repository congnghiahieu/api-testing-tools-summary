============================== HYPOTHESIS OUTPUT ===============================
WARNING: Hypothesis has spent more than five minutes working to shrink a failing example, and stopped because it is making very slow progress.  When you re-run your tests, shrinking will resume and may take this long before aborting again.
PLEASE REPORT THIS if you can provide a reproducing example, so that we can improve shrinking performance for everyone.
